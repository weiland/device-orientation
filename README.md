# Phone Orientation Detectio

### How does that example work?
Open following page on your mobile phone: http://weiland.github.io/device-orientation/
(we need deviceorientation eventlistener support)

First put your phone on your table. (one should see the earthball)
Then start rotating your phone.

Second, hold the phone like you want to take a picture of the person in front of you. (The earthball should disappear and a blue square should appear)
You can rotate your phone again. (this example is a bit buggy)
