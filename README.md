# Phone Orientation Detectio

### How does that example work?
First put your phone on your table. (one should see the earthball)
Then start rotating your phone.

Second, hold the phone like you want to take a picture of the person in front of you. (The earthball should disappear and a blue square should appear)
You can rotate your phone again. (this example is a bit buggy)
